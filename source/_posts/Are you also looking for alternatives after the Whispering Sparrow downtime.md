This was a huge blow to users who relied on Whispering Sparrow, and their work or life was severely affected. I had been using it at the time and thought it was a network problem, restarted it and it was still the same.

## I. The Whispering Sparrow Incident

 On October 23, 2023, Whispering Sparrow suffered a catastrophic crash that resulted in an 8-hour service outage. This was a huge blow to users who relied on Whispering Sparrow, and their work or life was severely affected. I had been using it at the time and thought it was a network problem, restarted it and it was still the same.

>  "Some users said that the company's product manager drank tea for an afternoon because he couldn't open Whisper Sparrow..."

Language Sparrow has been used internally in the Ali system since its launch, and it has also spread rapidly in the technical circle. According to statistics Language Sparrow was launched for Ali's production and research teams from 2016 and officially opened to the public in 2018. Language Sparrow currently has about 12 million users, serving more than 8,000 active team organizations and more than 1,200 public education organizations. Such an accident makes us think, how should we choose a suitable cloud note product? What cloud notebooks on the market are safer and more reliable? Are there any cloud note products that focus on local backup?

## Second, cloud note-taking products

How to choose from so many products?

### 2.1. Choose a product that focuses on local retention of original documents

You can see that after the incident with Language Sparrow, the articles on the Internet have a high appearance rate, including Obsidian and SiYuan Notes. Why? Because they pay more attention to local retention.

### 2.2, choose other cloud products

For example, choose Impression or Tencent Document, etc. ### 2.3.

### 2.3 Choose an editor product

There are also quite a few tech bros who have chosen to use the most primitive editor + netbook or github approach to replace the cloud notes product. To replace cloud notes through the editor is generally the following steps:

- Local editor to edit documents
- Configure the map bed through the plug-in
- Synchronization through the network disk

There are still a lot of brothers who love to toss 。。。。
